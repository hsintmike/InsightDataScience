### InsightDataScience Coding Challenge Final
***Hsin-Ju (Michael), Tung - ChemE Grad at University of Washingotn***

### Description

This is insight data science coding challenge. In this challenge, it requires you to:

"Calculate the average degree of a vertex in a Twitter hashtag graph for the last 60 seconds, and update this each time a new tweet appears.  You will thus be calculating the average degree over a 60-second sliding window."

The detail challenge instruction can see [here][1]

I wrote it in Python language to slove this challenge. The following will show the workflow and methods I used to slove this problem. To execute it, you can simply run `./run.sh` from the command line.


### Software dependencies

**All the required software is open source.**  The implementation was done using the following language and packages.

**Programming language:**   
Python version 2.7  ([https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/))

**Python packages needed:**
- NumPy 1.10.4
- pandas 0.18.0
